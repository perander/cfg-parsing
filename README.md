# cfg-parsing

This is a study project aiming to implement and compare two algorithms (CYK and Earley) parsing sentences either belonging or not to a language generated by a context-free grammar.

First I want to simply use the algorithms as deciders and compare their time and space complexities, as well as other factors affecting their performance.
