### Weekly report 2

#### What did I do?
- Tried implementing the CYK-algorithm based on pseudocode
- Thought about the CYK-algorithm and better ways to do it than pseudocodes i found
- Wrote the second weekly report

#### What's new in the program?
- A very rough and unpolished version of the CYK-algorithm
- A very simple and non-fault-proof 'user interface'
    - only takes in grammar rules in a specific format: rules stated as S NP VP, for example

#### What did I learn?
- How the CYK-algorithm actually works

#### What was left unclear or caused problems?
